    <richText>&#xD;Lots of changes are going on around here!&#xD;iWeb Buddy has finally been approved for release via the &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/buddy-for-iweb/id448345983?mt=12"&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt;.  This has a few impacts:&#xD;	1.	Anyone who is interested in purchasing iWeb Buddy can now download it directly from the Mac App Store.&#xD;	2.	iWeb Buddy has been renamed to &#x201C;Buddy for iWeb&#x201D;.  While this is unfortunate it is required by Apple to be in the Mac App Store.&#xD;	3.	We will no longer be offering iWeb Buddy for purchase directly from our website.&#xD;As always, if you run into any issues with this release, &lt;a href="mailto:support@zarrastudios.com?subject=iWeb%20Buddy%20connectivity%20issue"&gt;please let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;Changes since last build:&#xD;	&#x2022;	Fixed a crashing bug when trying to retrieve page thumbnail images.&#xD;	&#x2022;	This is probably the last release to support OS X 10.5 unless major bugs are discovered.&#xD;If you are an existing owner of iWeb Buddy then you can receive this latest update by checking for updates from within iWeb Buddy.&#xD;If you are new to iWeb Buddy, you can receive this update by downloading it from the Mac App Store.&#xD;Please enjoy this release of iWeb Buddy and report any issues you may find on our new support forum at &lt;a href="http://help.zarrastudios.com"&gt;http://help.zarrastudios.com&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;</richText>
