    <richText>Since all of the developers will be away at WWDC next week, we have decided to have a sale.  During the entire conference (and actually starting right now), seSales will be on sale for 40% off its retail price.  That brings the entry edition down to $149.40 from its original price of $249.00 and the standard edition down to an unbelievable $281.40 from its normal retail price of $469.00.&#xD;If you have been considering purchasing a license for seSales, there is no better time than right now!&#xD;&lt;a href="perma://BLHome//"&gt;MSZ&lt;/a&gt;</richText>
