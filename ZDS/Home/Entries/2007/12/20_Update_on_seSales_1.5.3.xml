    <richText>I realize that a large number of people have been anxiously awaiting the release of 1.5.3 for seSales. Unfortunately the final phase of testing has been taking a bit longer than expected.  &#xD;With the release of Leopard, Apple has made some subtle changes to the way that Currency Localization is done.  As a result we are making sure we get that localization perfect before releasing 1.5.3.  &#xD;I do apologize for the delays but it will definitely be worth it!&#xD;</richText>
