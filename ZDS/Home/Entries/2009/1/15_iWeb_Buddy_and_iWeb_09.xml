    <richText>We have been receiving a tremendous number of requests for support for iWeb 2009.&#xD;First, thank you all for the great feedback and the interest in a &#x2018;09 update.&#xD;Unfortunately, we are in the same situation all of you are.  We cannot purchase iLife &#x2019;09 either until the end of January so we do not know how badly it is going to break iWeb Buddy.&#xD;However, we will be supporting it shortly after it is released.  We are considering one of two options at this point:&#xD;	1.	 If the changes are minor then we will be updating iWeb Buddy to be compatible with &#x2018;08 and &#x2018;09 of iWeb.&#xD;	2.	 If the changes are overly complicated then we will create a &lt;b&gt;new&lt;/b&gt; version of iWeb Buddy that is compatible with iWeb &#x2019;09 and we will continue to support iWeb &#x2019;08 in the current iWeb Buddy.&#xD;Once we have had a chance to review the new iLife we will be posting more information here.  Trust me when I say that we will be picking up iLife &#x2019;09 as soon as it is available.&#xD;</richText>
