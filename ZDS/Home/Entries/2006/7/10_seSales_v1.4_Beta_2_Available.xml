    <richText>We just uploaded a new beta for everyone to review.  While the changes in this beta are not nearly as sweeping as the first beta they nevertheless do require a data file update.  Same warning as before applies (back up your data, not responsible for lost puppies, etc.).&#xD;If you run into any issues with this beta please let us know right away so that we can get the issue corrected for the next beta.  If you find a way to crash this beta, &lt;i&gt;please&lt;/i&gt; send us the crash report so that we can get the issue corrected right away.  If you have any questions feel free to write us at &lt;a href="mailto:support@zarrastudios.com"&gt;support@zarrastudios.com&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;The following items were changed or updated in this beta:&#xD;	&#x2022;	A correction was made to the rental serial number code.  A default serial number will now be generated when you select Product -&gt; Rental -&gt; Add Serial Number.&#xD;	&#x2022;	The rental menu items have been updated slightly to be disabled when an item is not flagged as &#x201C;rentable.&#x201D;&#xD;	&#x2022;	The ability to add an invoice item during the return process has been added.  In addition, it is possible to remove items from the invoice during the return process -- but only the items added during the return.&#xD;	&#x2022;	Instant Discounts!  You can now add an instant discount to an invoice as either a flat discount or a percentage off.  These discounts are trackable and a report for them will be available soon.&#xD;	&#x2022;	A few corrections to the printing of invoices which correct a bug when there is no employee active.&#xD;	&#x2022;	Item Management window should now remember the column sizes, order and window positions.&#xD;&lt;a href="perma://BLHome//"&gt;MSZ&lt;/a&gt;</richText>
