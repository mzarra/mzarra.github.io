    <richText>This is the first entry since the redesign of our website.  As you can see we have completely redone the site using Apple&#x2019;s new iWeb.  As you can also probably tell, this website is not 100% iWeb.  One of the main things that stopped us from doing this conversion sooner was the inability to have comments on our news items and the inability to add links to some of the tools provided by Google.&#xD;The issue with comments was recently resolved by Apple.  As of iWeb v1.1 comments are now included.&#xD;The issue with adding Google&#x2019;s tools was solved by a very useful tool called iWebEnhancer.  With this utility we were able to add additional html to our pages including the PayPal shopping links.  While the integration between iWeb and iWebEnhancer is not 100% perfect, it is a very simple solution to a major problem in iWeb.&#xD;So here we are.  We write our software on a Mac, we sell our software for Macs and now we design our website with a Mac.  thanks to Apple and the other software developers out there, life just keeps getting better.&#xD;&lt;a href="perma://BLHome//"&gt;MSZ&lt;/a&gt;</richText>
