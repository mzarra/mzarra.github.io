    <richText>While we still have a few lingering issues with 1.5, overall it is stable and we are pleased with its progress.  Therefore to celebrate that fact, we are giving you the public release of iWeb Buddy 1.5. &#xD;You can download the latest beta from &lt;a href="http://iwebbuddy.s3.amazonaws.com/iwb_1.5.zip"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;This does not mean that we have stopped working on iWeb Buddy!  We are aware that a few people are having connection issues and we are exploring those issues.  Once they are resolved we will do a maintenance release to correct those issues.&#xD;Please enjoy this release of iWeb Buddy and report any issues you may find on our new support forum at &lt;a href="http://help.zarrastudios.com"&gt;http://help.zarrastudios.com&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;</richText>
