      <description>&lt;br/&gt;Lots of changes are going on around here!&lt;br/&gt;iWeb Buddy has finally been approved for release via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/buddy-for-iweb/id448345983?mt=12&quot;&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt;.  This has a few impacts:&lt;br/&gt;	1.	Anyone who is interested in purchasing iWeb Buddy can now download it directly from the Mac App Store.&lt;br/&gt;	2.	iWeb Buddy has been renamed to “Buddy for iWeb”.  While this is unfortunate it is required by Apple to be in the Mac App Store.&lt;br/&gt;	3.	We will no longer be offering iWeb Buddy for purchase directly from our website.&lt;br/&gt;As always, if you run into any issues with this release, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:support@zarrastudios.com?subject=iWeb%20Buddy%20connectivity%20issue/&quot;&gt;please let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;Changes since last build:&lt;br/&gt;	•	Fixed a crashing bug when trying to retrieve page thumbnail images.&lt;br/&gt;	•	This is probably the last release to support OS X 10.5 unless major bugs are discovered.&lt;br/&gt;If you are an existing owner of iWeb Buddy then you can receive this latest update by checking for updates from within iWeb Buddy.&lt;br/&gt;If you are new to iWeb Buddy, you can receive this update by downloading it from the Mac App Store.&lt;br/&gt;Please enjoy this release of iWeb Buddy and report any issues you may find on our new support forum at &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.zarrastudios.com/&quot;&gt;http://help.zarrastudios.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;</description>
